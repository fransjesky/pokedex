### About This Project

This project initially began as a practice exercise for me to learn TypeScript and pagination. However, I became determined to enhance it as much as possible, both visually and functionally.

I know there are still many areas that need improvement, but for now, I am using this project repository solely for documentation. If you’d like to contribute to or improve this project, or if you want to learn from it, feel free to fork the repository.

### Limitation

Below is a list of known limitations of this project:

- The current app lacks a loading state when fetching data from the API.
- The pagination is very basic; there are no options to navigate directly to the first or last page.
- The folder structure is disorganized. As I mentioned earlier, this project initially started as a practice exercise, so I didn’t plan for scalability, resulting in a chaotic folder structure.
